        "\n",
        "Our YY1 positive sequences were collected from 6 different cell lines, 'A549', 'GM12878', 'GM12892', 'H1hESC', 'HepG2', and 'K562'. The first check made was whether sequences that were highly dependent on biophysical features for improved prediction performance had any overlap across the different cell lines. The goal was to see if the overlap extended to other TFs and cell lines as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "We were using zero-nullification at inference initially. Zero nullification at inference gives input to the model evaluation phase that has a zero matrix in place of the biophysical features. The model output with features was then subtracted from the model output without features to get the effect of the biophysical features on the model output. The top ten sequences with the greatest difference were then tested for overlap across cell lines.\n",
