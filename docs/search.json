    "text": "Data overview\nThe original ChIP-seq dataset used to create these results was a dataset of 886625 sequences, with each sequence having a length of 500 basepairs. To reduce the size of each sequence, 150 basepairs of flanking sequences were removed from either side of the sequence. To further reduce the number of sequences we had to simulate bubble data for, we filtered out sequences with positive label values for the TFs in question, making sure we had at least 3000 sequences with a positive hit for each TF. This criteria left us with 26391 sequences in total. The overall distribution of positive label values per TF is shown below:\n\n\nTable 3: Distribution of positive label values for each TF in the dataset.\n\n\nTF, Motif Matrix ID\nPositive Label Values\n\n\n\n\n(‘POU2F2’, ‘MA0507.2’)\n7561\n\n\n(‘CTCF’, ‘MA1929.1’)\n9613\n\n\n(‘ETS1’, ‘MA0098.3’)\n5070\n\n\n(‘JUND’, ‘MA0491.2’)\n4728\n\n\n(‘MAFK’, ‘MA0496.3’)\n3500\n\n\n(‘EBF1’, ‘MA0154.4’)\n7461\n\n\n(‘PAX5’, ‘MA0014.3’)\n8860\n\n\n\n\n\nBubble data\nAs in the gcPBM analysis, we used a bubble length threshold of 10 and an amplitude of 3.5 Armstrong. We used a probability threshold at the 95th percentile to decide if a position was positive for a bubble or not. With this threshold, 39.25% of the sequences had a bubble present.\n\n\nMotifs\nWe used the FIMO tool from the MEME suite to scan for motif presence. We used the following p-value thresholds to determine strong or weak motif matches:\np-value ≤ 1 x 10^-4 (strong motif match)\np-value &gt; 1 x 10^-4 and ≤ 1 x 10^-3 (weak motif match)\nIf a sequence had even a single strong motif match, it was classified as such with priority.

    "section": "Features of Interest",
    "text": "Features of Interest\n\nDNA Breathing:\nDNA breathing, also known as DNA fluctuations or thermal breathing, refers to the dynamic and transient opening and closing of base pairs in a DNA double helix. This phenomenon occurs due to the inherent flexibility of the DNA molecule and is driven by thermal fluctuations. As the temperature changes, the hydrogen bonds that hold the base pairs together weaken, causing the helix to locally unwind. These transient openings, or “breathing” events, can expose bases for potential interactions with other molecules, such as proteins like Transcription Factors (TFs). DNA breathing plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including DNA replication, transcription, and binding of regulatory proteins.\n\n\nDNA Bubble Features:\nA DNA bubble, in the context of molecular biology, is a region within a DNA double helix where the two strands temporarily separate, forming a single-stranded DNA loop flanked by double-stranded regions. These bubbles are created due to the thermal fluctuations that cause the hydrogen bonds between base pairs to momentarily break. DNA bubble features encompass the size, stability, and dynamics of these transient openings in the DNA structure. Understanding DNA bubble features is important as they influence processes like DNA unwinding during replication and transcription initiation.\n\n\nDNA Flipping:\nDNA flipping, also known as base flipping, is a structural alteration in DNA where a specific nucleotide base is rotated or flipped out of its usual position in the double helix. This alteration exposes the base in a way that makes it more accessible for interactions with other molecules. DNA flipping often occurs when certain enzymes, such as DNA methyltransferases, need to chemically modify the exposed base. The transient opening and flipping of bases are facilitated by specific protein complexes that temporarily disrupt the hydrogen bonding between the base pairs. DNA flipping is crucial for epigenetic modifications, repair processes, and DNA-protein interactions, making it a significant mechanism in gene regulation and genome maintenance."

CNNs are inspired by the visual cortex’s organization in animals, where neurons respond to specific localized regions of the visual field. Similarly, CNNs operate by convolving learnable filters (kernels) over input data, allowing them to capture local patterns and features. The network’s architecture includes layers for convolution, pooling, and fully connected operations, enabling hierarchical feature extraction. In the context of this project, CNNs are employed to analyze DNA sequences and biophysical features, facilitating the identification of intricate patterns related to Transcription Factor (TF) binding."

We concluded that the biophysical features were indeed useful in predicting TF binding, and the hybrid model was the most effective in leveraging these features.\nThe first conclusion derived was that YY1 (a TF) relied strongly (stronger than other TFs) on biophysical features to moderate binding affinity, and so the first investigation performed was to evaluate YY1."

We were initially doing this using zero-nullification at inference, which means that in the test-set of the model, the evaluation with biophysical features would be subtracted by an evaluation with the biophysical features being forcibly replaced with a zero-array. We also performed nullification by comparing our model’s output with the output of a model trained without biophysical features, or with the biophysical feature channels replaced with gaussian noise.\nThe sequences with the highest difference (prediction score diffence between feature model and nullified model) were sorted, and then the overlap between different cell lines within YY1 was evaluated. This gave us two analyses. One was simply a list of the sequences with overlap, and the other was a clustermap with the overlap of sequences being displayed as heat. This methodology was extended to all cell lines and TFs in the dataset.\nThe same process was repeated with different model parameters and nullification methods."

This means that the sequences are not subject to the same biases as ChIP-seq data, and the binding affinity is measured directly, rather than inferred from the binding strength of the TF. The sequences are also much shorter, at 36 base pairs, and the data is much more sparse, with only 3 TFs. However, the data is much more reliable, and the sequences are much more likely to be true binding sites. The affinity is a value between 0 and 1, with 1 being the highest affinity.\nInvestigations into CNN performance were done initially, but the models showed minimal to no improvements when biophysical features were introduced. We then focused on statistical analyses to see if there was any correlation between bubble features and binding affinity. We also ran correlation tests between the average flipping feature value for a motif occurrence and the binding affinity of the sequence, and then correlations between the average flipping feature for individual base pair positions and the binding affinity of the sequence."

Barplots showing the correlation (and associated p-value) between flipping features and binding affinity for motifs, for each position in the motif (top 5 significant motifs + PAX5 and EBF1).\n\n\nOur findings echo the gcPBM results, with different TF motifs having different correlations between flipping features and binding affinity, and different positions across the motif having different correlations.\nFollowing these results, we decided to use the top 5 most significant motifs (as well as PAX5 and EBF1 as suggested by our collaborator’s results) to recreate the tests done in the gcPBM analysis."

    "text": "Our hypothesis is that flipping features inside or near motifs may determine binding affinity. To test this, we extracted all DNA sequences with motifs. Then we computed the average flipping feature across all positions in the motifs, and found the correlation between this average flipping feature and the binding affinity of the sequence for every sequence.\nThe ChIP-seq data used to create these results was a dataset of 886625 sequences, with each sequence having a length of 500 basepairs. To reduce the size of each sequence, 150 basepairs of flanking sequences were removed from either side of the sequence.\nA total of 137 different cell lines and 64 TFs were represented in the Chip-seq peaks. For each sequence, the presence of binding in each cell line was represented as a binary value. The binding affinity of the sequence to a particular TF was computed as the average of the binary values across all cell lines.\n\n\nTable 1: Correlations of flipping features and binding affinity for

    "text": "Data overview\nThe original ChIP-seq dataset used to create these results was a dataset of 886625 sequences, with each sequence having a length of 500 basepairs. To reduce the size of each sequence, 150 basepairs of flanking sequences were removed from either side of the sequence. To further reduce the number of sequences we had to simulate bubble data for, we filtered out sequences with positive label values for the TFs in question, making sure we had at least 3000 sequences with a positive hit for each TF. This criteria left us with 26391 sequences in total. The overall distribution of positive label values per TF is shown below:\n\n\nTable 3: Distribution of positive label values for each TF in the dataset.\n\n\nTF, Motif Matrix ID\nPositive Label Values\n\n\n\n\n(‘POU2F2’, ‘MA0507.2’)\n7561\n\n\n(‘CTCF’, ‘MA1929.1’)\n9613\n\n\n(‘ETS1’, ‘MA0098.3’)\n5070\n\n\n(‘JUND’, ‘MA0491.2’)\n4728\n\n\n(‘MAFK’, ‘MA0496.3’)\n3500\n\n\n(‘EBF1’, ‘MA0154.4’)\n7461\n\n\n(‘PAX5’, ‘MA0014.3’)\n8860\n\n\n\n\n\nBubble data\nAs in the gcPBM analysis, we used a bubble length threshold of 10 and an amplitude of 3.5 Armstrong.

With this threshold, 10359 out of 26391 (39.25%) of the sequences had a bubble present.\n\n\nMotifs\nWe used the FIMO tool from the MEME suite to scan for motif presence.

Then we computed the average flipping feature across all positions in the motifs, and found the correlation between this average flipping feature and the binding affinity of the sequence for every sequence.\nThe ChIP-seq data used to create these results was a dataset of 886625 sequences, with each sequence having a length of 500 basepairs.

Then we computed the average flipping feature across all positions in the motifs, and found the correlation between this average flipping feature and the binding affinity of the sequence for every sequence.\nThe ChIP-seq data used to create these results was a dataset of 886625 sequences, with each sequence having a length of 500 basepairs. To reduce the size of each sequence, 150 basepairs of flanking sequences were removed from either side of the sequence, leaving a total of 200 basepairs.\nA total of 137 different cell lines and 64 TFs were represented in the ChIP-seq peaks.

The binding affinity of the cell line (per TF) with the highest number of positive values was taken as the binding affinity of the sequence to a particular TF.\n\n\nTable 1: Correlations of flipping features and binding affinity for motifs, averaged across the motif occurrences for a given motif (***: p-value &lt; 5e-200, **: p-value &lt; 5e-100, *: p-value &lt; 5e-10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTF\nMotif Matrix ID\nSignificance\nFlip Correlation\nFlip P-value\nCoord Correlation\nCoord P-value\nCoord2 Correlation\nCoord2 P-value\n\n\n\n\nZBTB7A\nMA0750.2\n***\n-0.219\n0\n-0.222\n0\n-0.221\n0\n\n\nETS1\nMA0098.3\n***\n-0.213\n0\n-0.217\n0\n-0.217\n0\n\n\nMAFK\nMA0496.3\n***\n0.207\n0\n0.227\n0\n0.214\n0\n\n\nE2F6\nMA0471.2\n***\n-0.2\n0\n-0.191\n0\n-0.203\n0\n\n\nNFYB\nMA0502.2\n***\n0.18\n0\n0.175\n0\n0.178\n0\n\n\nPOU2F2\nMA0507.2\n***\n-0.16\n4.36759e-247\n-0.153\n2.38861e-226\n-0.164\n1.0688e-261\n\n\nCEBPB\nMA0466.3\n***\n0.159\n1.09438e-248\n0.166\n2.32767e-271\n0.156\n5.07059e-239\n\n\nELF1\nMA0473.3\n***\n-0.151\n0\n-0.148\n2.21934e-318\n-0.155\n0\n\n\nGABPA\nMA0062.3\n***\n-0.132\n3.15451e-250\n-0.129\n3.46623e-241\n-0.134\n3.95138e-259\n\n\nBATF\nMA1634.1\n***\n0.131\n0\n0.13\n0\n0.125\n4.4871e-320\n\n\nEBF1\nMA0154.4\n***\n0.122\n2.19183e-247\n0.111\n1.09086e-203\n0.123\n1.92057e-249\n\n\nSP1\nMA0079.5\n***\n-0.122\n0\n-0.122\n0\n-0.124\n0\n\n\nJUND\nMA0491.2\n***\n-0.115\n2.80143e-284\n-0.118\n4.99183e-296\n-0.12\n9.92263e-307\n\n\nZBTB33\nMA0527.1\n**\n0.158\n2.77515e-124\n0.164\n2.23709e-134\n0.154\n2.7953e-118\n\n\nJUND\nMA0492.1\n**\n-0.13\n9.99296e-186\n-0.129\n2.99312e-183\n-0.129\n3.76444e-184\n\n\nMAX\nMA0058.3\n**\n-0.121\n3.02992e-132\n-0.119\n1.78912e-128\n-0.125\n2.40868e-141\n\n\nATF3\nMA0605.2\n**\n-0.117\n1.20309e-100\n-0.116\n4.33041e-100\n-0.116\n3.12074e-99\n\n\nCTCF\nMA0139.1\n**\n-0.112\n9.43515e-191\n-0.111\n6.27638e-185\n-0.111\n1.07662e-187\n\n\nFOSL1\nMA0477.2\n**\n-0.111\n3.0724e-137\n-0.113\n4.83459e-143\n-0.118\n5.79912e-154\n\n\nMEF2A\nMA0052.4\n**\n-0.091\n1.85054e-133\n-0.094\n3.44107e-144\n-0.091\n9.31153e-136\n\n\nFOXA1\nMA0148.4\n**\n-0.089\n7.15563e-105\n-0.093\n5.66394e-115\n-0.093\n6.87981e-114\n\n\nTFAP2C\nMA0814.2\n**\n-0.078\n8.25091e-105\n-0.074\n1.93678e-96\n-0.078\n1.38586e-104\n\n\nCTCF\nMA1929.1\n**\n-0.078\n2.00795e-104\n-0.077\n1.99388e-103\n-0.076\n3.45796e-101\n\n\nCTCF\nMA1930.1\n*\n-0.08\n7.67029e-97\n-0.08\n4.11398e-96\n-0.079\n6.17608e-94\n\n\nTHAP1\nMA0597.2\n*\n-0.076\n3.37396e-85\n-0.076\n1.63983e-84\n-0.077\n1.10762e-85\n\n\nZNF143\nMA0088.2\n*\n-0.075\n1.19298e-62\n-0.078\n1.7465e-67\n-0.076\n2.25375e-63\n\n\nBHLHE40\nMA0464.2\n*\n-0.071\n1.05203e-36\n-0.062\n3.63039e-28\n-0.074\n2.64074e-40\n\n\nFOXA2\nMA0047.3\n*\n-0.067\n1.60944e-59\n-0.068\n5.33284e-61\n-0.075\n5.83597e-74\n\n\nTFAP2C\nMA0815.1\n*\n-0.062\n6.62078e-57\n-0.063\n3.23473e-57\n-0.062\n1.068e-56\n\n\nGATA2\nMA0036.3\n*\n-0.061\n5.67575e-34\n-0.062\n1.33564e-35\n-0.068\n1.85265e-42\n\n\nTFAP2C\nMA0524.2\n*\n-0.056\n9.49061e-45\n-0.055\n1.4853e-43\n-0.054\n3.88442e-41\n\n\nIRF4\nMA1419.1\n*\n-0.055\n9.16276e-25\n-0.056\n1.03468e-25\n-0.055\n7.89247e-25\n\n\nRUNX3\nMA0684.2\n*\n0.053\n7.83515e-35\n0.072\n1.39526e-62\n0.044\n4.13134e-24\n\n\nTCF12\nMA1648.1\n*\n-0.053\n1.13241e-33\n-0.045\n1.14874e-24\n-0.054\n4.76174e-35\n\n\nSRF\nMA0083.3\n*\n-0.046\n4.68152e-13\n-0.044\n8.24727e-12\n-0.049\n1.93211e-14\n\n\nRFX5\nMA0510.2\n*\n-0.041\n5.98153e-14\n-0.041\n1.0186e-13\n-0.043\n1.23803e-14\n\n\nFOSL2\nMA0478.1\n*\n-0.035\n4.59591e-16\n-0.038\n1.46457e-18\n-0.043\n1.09646e-23\n\n\nTCF7L2\nMA0523.1\n*\n-0.03\n5.17712e-13\n-0.031\n4.05744e-13\n-0.031\n1.73511e-13\n\n\nUSF1\nMA0093.3\n*\n-0.029\n2.2203e-14\n-0.031\n1.46036e-16\n-0.033\n2.45195e-18\n\n\nEGR1\nMA0162.4\n*\n-0.026\n2.45873e-10\n-0.029\n7.66107e-13\n-0.028\n4.80071e-12\n\n\nNR2F2\nMA1111.1\n\n-0.023\n1.21751e-07\n-0.022\n5.21737e-07\n-0.026\n2.37705e-09\n\n\nPAX5\nMA0014.3\n\n-0.02\n0.000190657\n-0.013\n0.0130774\n-0.022\n4.00639e-05\n\n\nPRDM1\nMA0508.3\n\n0.016\n0.000218144\n0.019\n9.84675e-06\n0.017\n8.1423e-05\n\n\nHNF4A\nMA1494.1\n\n-0.013\n0.00710976\n-0.01\n0.0413124\n-0.016\n0.000885489\n\n\nUSF2\nMA0526.4\n\n-0.008\n0.0555673\n-0.008\n0.0767562\n-0.011\n0.0128699\n\n\nTEAD4\nMA0809.2\n\n-0.008\n0.0461113\n-0.008\n0.0443172\n-0.009\n0.023208\n\n\nSTAT3\nMA0144.2\n\n0.006\n0.0628939\n0.003\n0.348607\n0.005\n0.116561\n\n\nREST\nMA0138.2\n\n-0.006\n0.113882\n-0.002\n0.489563\n-0.006\n0.0743506\n\n\nHNF4A\nMA0114.4\n\n-0.005\n0.28178\n-0.003\n0.546721\n-0.009\n0.0345792\n\n\nPBX3\nMA1114.1\n\n-0.001\n0.842046\n0.007\n0.0448875\n-0.002\n0.569692\n\n\n\n\nFollowing these results, we decided to use the top 5 most highly correlated TFs, both positive and negative, to recreate the tests done in the gcPBM analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Results of Selected TFs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: The top 5 positive and top 5 negative most correlated TFs.

    "text": "Data overview\nThe original ChIP-seq dataset used to create these results was a dataset of 886625 sequences, with each sequence having a length of 500 basepairs. To reduce the size of each sequence, 150 basepairs of flanking sequences were removed from either side of the sequence. To further reduce the number of sequences we had to simulate bubble data for, we filtered out sequences with positive label values for the TFs in question, making sure we had at least 3000 sequences with a positive hit for each TF. This criteria left us with 41268 sequences in total.\n\nBubble data\nAs in the gcPBM analysis, we used a bubble length threshold of 10 and an amplitude of 3.5 Armstrong. We used a probability threshold at the 95th percentile to decide if a position was positive for a bubble or not. With this threshold, 16301 out of 41268 (39.50%) of the sequences had a bubble present.\n\n\nMotifs\nWe used the FIMO tool from the MEME suite to scan for motif presence. We used the following p-value thresholds to determine strong or weak motif matches:\np-value ≤ 1 x 10^-4 (strong motif match)\np-value &gt; 1 x 10^-4 and ≤ 1 x 10^-3 (weak motif match)\nThe overall number of sequences with strong and weak motif matches per TF is shown below, along with label and bubble distributions:\n\n\nTable 3: The number of sequences with positive and negative labels, and the number of sequences with bubbles and motifs for each TF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Labels\nNegative Labels\nSequences with Bubbles\nSequences with Strong Motifs\nSequences with Weak Motifs\nSequences with Strong and Weak Motifs\n\n\n\n\nMAFK\n3596\n31735\n13938\n4217\n7243\n1752\n\n\nNFYB\n3166\n32165\n13938\n2582\n6300\n754\n\n\nCEBPB\n3130\n32201\n13938\n555\n4260\n99\n\n\nBATF\n5130\n30201\n13938\n3874\n4857\n2617\n\n\nEBF1\n7641\n27690\n13938\n5005\n3767\n1756\n\n\nZBTB7A\n4620\n30711\n13938\n5752\n11238\n2662\n\n\nETS1\n5733\n29598\n13938\n2898\n13257\n1282\n\n\nE2F6\n6392\n28939\n13938\n8053\n6036\n2588\n\n\nPOU2F2\n8135\n27196\n13938\n1409\n6305\n487\n\n\nELF1\n8974\n26357\n13938\n6306\n9892\n1907"
